# Welcome to my page!
## My name is Madelaine and this is a page that I am using to learn Github for my seminar college class
Here I will most likely have:
- Photos of my animals
- Photos of my projects
- Random stuff until I figure this out

**Now I am testing out bold text** and _Italic text_, **I can _combine the types_** text _Like **this**_

Here, have a picture of **my cat**
