# Welcome to my page!
## My name is Madelaine and this is a page that I am using to learn Github for my seminar college class
Here I will most likely have:
- Photos of my animals
- Photos of my projects
- Random stuff until I figure this out

**Now I am testing out bold text** and _Italic text_, **I can _combine the types_** text _Like **this**_

Here, have a picture of **my cat**

And now that you have seen my cat please [click here](https://www.purina.com/cats/cat-breeds) to help me figure out what breed of cat she is because we adopted her a year ago and I don't know but it'd be cool to know.
